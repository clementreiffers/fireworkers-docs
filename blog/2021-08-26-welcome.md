## Why This Project? What's Next?

This project was undertaken during an internship with the aim of addressing the question: "Does the recent release of 
the Cloudflare Workers runtime as open source enable its utilization in a Hybrid Cloud or Sovereign Cloud environment?"

The primary objective of this project is to enable the deployment of code in a serverless manner.

There are several areas where enhancements can be made, including:

1. Secrets management: While secrets management exists in the FakeCfApi, it is currently not integrated with Kubernetes 
Operators. Improving this integration would enhance the overall security and reliability of the project.

2. Deployment time reduction: One possible avenue for improvement is the utilization of Firecracker, which could expedite
the creation of images and subsequently reduce deployment times. Implementing this optimization would lead to more efficient 
workflows.

3. Full integration with Cloudflare API: A key aspect to consider is fully mimicking the Cloudflare API to achieve seamless
integration with Wrangler. This would ensure comprehensive compatibility and provide users with the full range of Cloudflare 
functionalities.

4. Ensuring KubeEdge compatibility: To maximize the benefits of the project and leverage CDN services offered by other 
Cloud Providers, it is essential to ensure compatibility with KubeEdge. This would enable users to utilize various CDN 
services seamlessly across different providers.

As the project moves forward, these areas of improvement will be addressed to enhance security, speed up deployment 
processes, achieve comprehensive API integration, and facilitate compatibility with KubeEdge for expanded CDN service 
options.
